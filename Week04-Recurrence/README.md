#269B - Buttons

We just have to find the worst case scenario in each buttons inputted, so as we see the input and output in the question, the pattern
has found, *(n - 1) * n * (n + 1) / 6 + n* , so just input the buttons, and just print the pattern, its simple, just have to find the 
pattern first.

The complexity of this problem is O(1)

#598D - Igor In the Museum

Igor is in the msueum which represented as rectangular n x m, if empty cells will be marked with
*'.'* and if it's marked *'*', So the first line input contains 3 integers, n,m, and k 
(the museum dimensions and the number of starting positions to process)

Each k lines contains 2 integers x (row) and y (column) which is Igor's starting positions.

Row are numbered from top to bottom and columns from left to right.

then print the k integers which the maximum number of pictures, that Igor can see.
