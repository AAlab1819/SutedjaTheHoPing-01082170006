# 20C - Dijkstra

From this problem we have to find the path. And we need to use a tupler. From the code needed a tupler because we need to store the running cost, the source, and the destination and we have to keep track of the path by using a source array, which the index stores the previous path before reaching the index. Perform Dijkstra's algorithm, but keep track of the source. After we using the Dijkstra algorithm we have to find the process using stack and pop them all up. This will return the path so that we can find the minimum path. 

Complexity: O(E x log(V))

# 601A - The Two Routes

From this problem, we have to find the longest time from a vehicle from travelling for travelling from 1 city to another.<br>
