=====
The Problem of Tricky Alchemy are, how many Grisha needs the colour crystal which is have 2 colours, yellow and blue to make crystals for the amount of colour balls as he wants.
Then we just have to make the calculations like this:
1.So from the questions given, "*It's known that to produce a yellow ball one needs two yellow crystals, green â€” one yellow and one blue, and for a blue ball, three blue crystals are enough.*
`if (cy<(2*y+g))
     a+=((2*y+g)-cy);`
