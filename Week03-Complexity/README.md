# 148A - Insomnia Cure

The problem of Insomnia Cure is to find the total of damaged dragons, and the damage divided by 4 types, from 1-4 is the input for the
damaged dragon and the 5th input will be the total dragons, in the first case, if there's 1 in any of the four input, it means that
all the dragon are damaged, because every number can be divided by 1, so im using if condition if there's 1 in any of the four input,
i initialize the damaged dragons same as the total dragons, and for the next using for loop to check how many number that will divisible 
from 1 to total dragons inputted, if it divisible then i'll make a counter and the counter will plus 1 everytime the number are divisible,
and for the last just output the counter.

Best Case : Ω(n)
Average Case : θ(n)
Worst Case : O(n)
