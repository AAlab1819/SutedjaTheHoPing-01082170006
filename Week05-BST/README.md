#115A - Party
The problem of 115A is to count how many group that can be made, for example for 5 employee, if there's "-1" employee, it means 
the employee don't have manager, and when the party held, an employee is prohibited to meet their manager(superior).
The first line input will be the n number of employees.

The next input are the i-th employees.

And for the output will be the number of groups that has been formed.

```
Input
5
-1
1
2

Output

```
As we can see from the example given, 3 groups formed, from employee 1, employee 2 and 4, and employee 3 and 5, the employee can be
formed with their superior, but not the immediate manager.
