# 946A - Partition

From this problem, first thing that we have to divide the list into two, list B and list C, next we have to
find the maximum value from list B minus list C (B-C).<br>
The first line of input will be the total elements.<br>
Second line of input is the value.<br>
and the out put is the maximum value of B-C.<br>
After that, we use for loop for the elements, and if the value is negative, we put the elements
to list C, and the positive to list B.<br>
Complexity: O(n).

# 731B - Coupons and Discounts

Coupons and Discounts' problem are, we have to check if sereja can only use and discounts only
for purchasing the pizza. Sereja can get 1 pizza for 2 days if he use the coupons, but if he use discount, 
sereja can only get 2 pizza in the same day. I'm using for loop to input the number of teams, 
then the next for is to check whether the teams that will come are even or odd, if the teams are odd, we have to check
for the next session whether they need extra pizza or not, and to check for the last session.
